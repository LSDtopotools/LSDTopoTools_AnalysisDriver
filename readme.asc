= LSDTopoTools Analyis Driver

This is a program to drive a number of analyses for raster manipulation and topograpic analysis using the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools software package].

You will need to build this program from source, but it should work as long as you have a functioning c++ compiler and the `make` utility. 

== Installation instructions

. Clone the code into a directory of your choice using `git`. 
  If you don't know how to do that, just download the files as a zip folder and unzip them in a directory of your choice. 

. Open a http://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it[terminal window] or https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/hh857343.aspx[powershell window] and make sure you have a compiler and the `make` utility. 
  You can check if you have these by typing `make --version` or `g++ --version`. You should be able to use another compiler but we use `g++`. 
  If you don't have `make` or a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler[compiler], you will need to get them. Please see https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_book[our book] for instructions.  
  
. Navigate to the `Analysis_driver` folder and run the command:
+
[console,source]
----
$ make -f Driver_analysis_from_paramfile.make
----
. Ignore the warning. Hopefully there are no errors! If compilation worked, you will have a program called `LSDTT_analysis_from_paramfile.out` in the *Analysis_driver* folder. 

. You are ready to run some analyses! See the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_book[book] for details.
