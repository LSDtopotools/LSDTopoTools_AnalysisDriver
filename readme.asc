= LSDTopoTools Analyis Driver

This repository contains a suite of basic routines for analysing topography. It is part of the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools software package].

== Getting started. 

These tools are much, much, much easier to get running in Linux than any other operating system. So if you run another operating system, you should create a virtual linux machine inside your computer using one of two options:

* http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_on_a_windows_machine_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[Our vagrant setup]. 
* https://github.com/AaronFriel/LSDTopoTools[docker]. Note the LSDTT development team haven't tested this but there is no reason for it not to work 

== Contents of this repository

* The *LSDTT Basic Metrics* program (which you need to compile, see below).
* Two other legacy programs which remain here to make sure users of the old programs are still supported: `DEM_prepocessing` and `Drive_analysis_from_paramfile`. *DO NOT USE THESE* if you are just starting. Use *LSDTT Basic Metrics* instead.  

=== Installation instructions

. Clone this repository. 
. Go into the `Analysis_driver` directory
. Run `make`:
+
[console,source]
----
$ make -f LSDTT_BasicMetrics.make
----
+
. Ignore the warnings. If compilation worked (and it should do as long as the build is passing), you will have a program called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics.exe` in the *Analysis_driver* folder. 

. You are ready to run some analyses! We haven't fully documented this yet but some examples https://simon-m-mudd.github.io/QGIS_book/#_an_example_using_data_from_lsdtopotools[can be found here].
